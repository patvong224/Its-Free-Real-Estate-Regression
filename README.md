# Real-Estate-Regression

What it does:

This program is to practice my skills with machine learning and espacially the linear regression alogrithm. It gets data from the csv file and manipulates that data to get the price of land. Multiple variables were used that were included in the csv file. This was primarily developed in Amazon's Sagemaker.

Why its useful:

To just create a program to practice linear regression. This is my first program so it is quite sloppy. 

How to get started:

Install the nessasary packages and libraries (sklearn, pandas, numPy, matplotlib).
For a more easier way to run everything, just sign up for Amazon Sagemaker and use their JupyterLab (It cost money in the long run!).
Then run the RealEstate.py file.

For help just email me at patvong224@gmail.com!

There is only one individual who has contributed to this poor project.
